2. Why do Github users need an SSH key pair? (Users can use either SSH key pair or github account info.) Please write down a brief explanation of SSH key
Although it is possible to type in your GitHub account name and password every time you write code, it is too troublesome and annoying to do so if you are a developer. Then you can get yourself a pair of SSH key and pass one onto the server, so that you and the server can securely transmit information using various encryption methods. The workings of SSH differs depending on the encryption you are using, but most of them rely on mathematical foundations so that it is proven to be secure once the key has been distributed without eavesdropping.
