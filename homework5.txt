1. What is .gitignore? You can write the answer either in Korean or English.

A .gitignore file is a file that specifies a list of files to be excluded from Git version management.

2. Why do Github users need an SSH key pair? (Users can use either SSH key pair or github account info.) Please write down a brief explanation of SSH key

There are two kinds of SSH keys. Public keys and private Keys. One Public key is matched with one private key. This is called a key pair. A client makes a pair and copies the public key to a server. After that the server sends the client messages encrypted with the public key. These are only decrypted by the matched private Key. Because only the client have the private key, SSH can ensure the safe data transition.
SSH can be used in identifying yourself to Github. Github account info also can be used. But when using SSH user does not have to type in the password. So a lot of Github users have copied their SSH public key to Github server.
