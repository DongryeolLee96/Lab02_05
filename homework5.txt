2. SSH is a security protocol to help one pc to communicate with others. Method of SSH is largely divided by 3 types, Symmetric Encryption, Asymmetric Encryption and Hashing. First one Use only public key to securify so it is fatal to leak the key. Second one has two keys, public and private. Users share their own public keys to encrypt and use private key to open the file. The final one is to prevent hacking which is made before connection by SSH. Hash sends MAC to verify the data. It is needed because it is important to keep Not Allowed users away from the repo or project. Also it is for higher level security and for automatic login system.
